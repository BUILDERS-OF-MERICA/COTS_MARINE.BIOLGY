I am working on the initial stages of the solution package for keeping a census on the Dugong water species. Ways to re structure the current state of the society in order to control population of endandgered species. I will implement a paradigm shift of a nuetral finction. In order to manifest the values of the new program structures and protocols. 
I will be working on A.I systems and Neural Net Deep Learning object recognition. CGI. Server striclty for marine life data.  Algorithms embedded for sustaining over all program growth and success. All the way to protocols of CRISPR and DNA data banks for restoration o
f exstinct species.
